      <description>This project looks at the problem of forecasting future values of time-series data. Wikipedia has over 145,000 articles and their view counts available to analyze. Following the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process I was able to develop an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model that showed a prediction of view counts for the following 45 â€“ 60 days. Web forecasting is gaining popularity and has many applications including load balancing for cloud services, and understanding user behavior.</description>

      <description>Performed a multiple regression analysis on South Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP growth. South Korea in the 1950s came out of the Korean War, which left it&amp;rsquo;s country ravaged and in extreme poverty. However, South Korea would go through one most significant economic developments the World has seen, taking it from a country in poverty to one of the top 15 economies in the World today.
